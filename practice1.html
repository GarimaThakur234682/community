    <p style="font-size: large; color: black;">The orphanage house was situated in the outskirts of the city and was close to the national highway. It was a
        two-storey building with a garden out in the front and a small temple just on its east boundary. The walls of
        the home were old and the paint had worn off. It looked like the house was without maintenance for years
        together. There was a small girl who was peeking through the window on the first floor when we opened the gate.

    <p style="font-size: large; color: black;">An orphanage is a facility that provides shelter, food, education, healthcare, and emotional support to children
        who have lost one or both parents or have been abandoned. These children are often vulnerable and face numerous
        challenges, including lack of basic needs, loneliness, and social stigma. Orphanages strive to create a safe and
        stable environment for these children, with the ultimate goal of finding them permanent homes through adoption
        or reunification with their families. The staff of orphanages often includes social workers, psychologists, and
        caretakers who provide the children with comfort, guidance, and love.</p>
